# A simple markdown editor with preview.

This is a markdown editor. Yup that's all.
It provides :

- Syntax Highlighting
- Github style markdown
- Loading local system files
- Saving the markdown file on system
- Autocompletion For common words

## FAQ

**Q. Why did I remove live preview ?**

A. I removed live preview as it was quite memory consuming and it freezed the editor on large files(150+ lines).
The site performance was also largely affected in 100+ line markdown. It was really annoying and killed the usage
of the app. Hence I removed live preview for convenience. If you have any suggestion feel free to open a issue.
